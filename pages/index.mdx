Howdy! I'm **Nayab Warach,** an **Electrical Engineering** student at **Texas A&M University**. Currently interning at HW Lochner in the Aviation division, I've contributed to diverse projects, from general aviation airport lighting and NAVAIDs to digital signage at major hubs like DFW International Airport.

I'm also a licensed amateur radio operator and actively involved as the Treasurer of W5AC, the Texas A&M Amateur Radio Club. Additionally, I contribute as a System Administrator at KANM Student Radio, where I fuse my engineering curiosity with creative expression.

I believe that engineering is about impactful solutions, and I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities. Let's connect and make a difference together!
